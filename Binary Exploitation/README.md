# Binary Exploitation / Pwn

Binaries, or executables, are machine code for a computer to execute. For the most part, the binaries that you will face in CTFs are Linux ELF files or the occasional windows executable. Binary Exploitation is a broad topic within Cyber Security which really comes down to finding a vulnerability in the program and exploiting it to gain control of a shell or modifying the program's functions.

Common topics addressed by Binary Exploitation or 'pwn' challenges include:
