Forensics is the art of recovering the digital trail left on a computer. There are plently of methods to find data which is seemingly deleted, not stored, or worse, covertly recorded.

An important part of Forensics is having the right tools, as well as being familair with the following topics:

- [File Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format)
- [EXIF Data](https://ctf101.org/forensics/what-is-metadata/)
- [Wireshark & PCAPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireshark)
- [Steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography)
