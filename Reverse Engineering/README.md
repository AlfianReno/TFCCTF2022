# Reverse Engineering

Reverse Engineering in a CTF is typically the process of taking a compiled (machine code, bytecode) program and converting it back into a more human readable format.

Very often the goal of a reverse engineering challenge is to understand the functionality of a given program such that you can identify deeper issues.
